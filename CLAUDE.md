# PFI — Permitting Friction Index

## Overview
Two-part project: a static marketing site and an internal team outreach system.

## Marketing Site (`index.html`)

### Tech Stack
- Single `index.html` file with inline CSS and JS (no build tools, no frameworks)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- No dependencies

### Page Structure
1. **Hero** — Full-viewport background image with logo and mist widget
2. **Flipper 1: Intro ↔ What PFI Measures** — Arrow-based page flipper with fade+slide animation
3. **Flipper 2: Initial Coverage ↔ Who Uses The PFI** — Split layout (image left/top, text flips right/below)
4. **Founding Subscribers** — Notion-style centered text with email link
5. **Footer**

### Flipper Mechanism
- Arrow buttons slide content horizontally like turning a page
- Coordinated animation: fade-out → 300ms delay → slide track + fade-in (1s cubic-bezier easing)
- Progressive reveal: sections hidden until user clicks through each flipper
- Flipper viewport height locks to active page content to prevent white space
- Flipper 2 text container height locks to active page; uses `align-items: flex-start` on track so pages size independently

### Design System
Notion-inspired design language with reusable CSS classes:
- `.notion-section`, `.notion-content` — Section containers (max-width: 720px, centered)
- `.notion-label` — Small gray category label
- `.notion-title` — Section heading (28px, semibold)
- `.notion-subheading` — Subsection heading (18px, bold)
- `.notion-body` — Body text (16px, #555)
- `.notion-split` — Two-column grid layout for image+text sections
- `.flipper-arrow` — Circular arrow button for flipping between content pages

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop** — Side-by-side grid for section 3, full nav text
- **Tablet (≤1024px)** — Reduced padding
- **Mobile (≤768px)** — LOCKED IN. Nav shows "PFI" instead of full name, section 3 stacks image above text (edge-to-edge), flipper2 labels hidden, footer centered
- **Small phone (≤400px)** — LOCKED IN. Further size reductions

## Outreach System (`Team/index.html`)

### Overview
Internal outreach automation tool at `permitfriction.com/Team`. Team members log in, manage LinkedIn leads, and use Claude Code + MCP to automate message writing and outreach.

### Tech Stack
- Single `Team/index.html` file with inline CSS and JS
- Firebase (Firestore) for data — project: `thepfi`
- MCP server (`Tools/mcp-server/`) bridging Claude Code ↔ Firestore
- Claude Code for automated email outreach; LinkedIn outreach is manual via dashboard
- Playwright used only during lead discovery (LinkedIn profile search), not for sending
- No Firebase Auth — simple email-based login matching against employee list in Firestore

### Screen Flow (4 screens, sequential)
1. **Login** — Employee name cards from Firestore. Click a name → enter email → matched against `company/employees`
2. **Onboarding** (first time only) — Install Claude Code, set up skill
3. **Setup** — Two terminal commands: start Claude Code with MCP server, then paste polling prompt
4. **Dashboard** — Lead table, action buttons (Find Leads, Add Lead, Write Messages, Perform Outreach, Proof Sheet)

### Architecture
- **Portal** writes tasks to `users/{uid}/tasks/` in Firestore
- **Claude Code** polls for tasks via MCP `poll_tasks` tool every 10s
- **Claude Code** executes tasks using MCP tools + external APIs + Playwright (lead discovery only)
- **Portal** updates in real time via Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners (leads table + daily counters)

### Lead Discovery & Outreach Flow (Signal-First, Fund-Level Targeting)
**Core principle:** The developer/operator is the evidence that pain exists. The institutional fund behind them is the customer. The tool finds both, but outreach goes to the fund.

**Pressure chain:** Project in permitting pain → Developer/operator → Who funded them → Fund-level contact

1. **Find Leads** → Agent searches for signal strength first across energy and non-energy sources, focused on TX, GA, AZ:
   - **Energy:** FERC queues, permits.performance.gov delayed milestones, state permit databases (TCEQ/GA EPD/AZ DEQ), ISO interconnection queues (ERCOT/MISO/SPP/Georgia Power/APS/SRP), capital commitments
   - **Data Centers:** State utility commission large load interconnection requests, county zoning/special use permits, state water authority permits, Army Corps Section 404 permits, FAA obstruction evaluation filings
   - **Manufacturing:** EPA Title V air permit applications, state NPDES industrial wastewater discharge permits, state economic development project announcements
   - **Transmission:** State PUC/PSC certificate of convenience and necessity dockets, NEPA environmental review tracker, BLM right-of-way applications
   - If a project appears in a non-energy source but not in an energy queue, still classify using Active Pain / Capital Pattern logic. Do not expand geography beyond TX, GA, AZ until instructed.
2. Each company classified as **Active Pain** (stuck in permitting now) or **Capital Pattern** (repeat builder, next project coming)
3. **Institutional backer lookup** — After confirming permitting pain, agent searches for the PE fund / infrastructure investor behind the company (e.g. "[Company] equity partner", "[Company] backed by", "[Company] investors"). Looking for names like Stonepeak, Brookfield, KKR, Apollo, etc. If not found after 3 searches → "backer not found" (row still saved)
4. Agent finds up to TWO fund-level contacts per firm using the project record as search context — searches combine fund name + project name + agency + state (not generic role searches). **Asset Manager** (priority 1: recalculates the pro forma when permits slip, provides raw data to IR) and **Investor Relations Manager** (priority 2: faces the LPs, explains underperformance, maintains the firm's narrative). Both saved as separate leads when found. If neither role is found at the fund, skip the company and move on
5. For each person: **always** get LinkedIn profile via Playwright, **then** try Hunter for email
6. Email found → `channel: 'email'`, lead has both email + LinkedIn | No email → `channel: 'linkedin'`, LinkedIn only
7. **Outreach**: Agent sends emails via Gmail SMTP only. LinkedIn connection requests are **manual** — user sends them and clicks the LinkedIn icon in the dashboard to mark complete.

### Proof Sheet (Structured Intelligence)
- **"Proof Sheet" button** on dashboard — runs a deep signal-first discovery pipeline and writes structured intelligence to a Google Sheet
- Modal: count input + helper text (Google Sheet ID is hardcoded: `1VjCQBw86I8vTTbqyJ8EyJI4XnbaZbnge2ihGsDud2uI`)
- Task type: `proofSheet` with `{ status, count, spreadsheetId, createdAt }`
- **Single "Proof Sheet" tab** with 7 columns: Company, Institutional Backer, Classification, What's Happening, Why Them, Key Contact, Source
- **Situational intelligence** ("What's Happening"): project name, capacity/MW, county/location, exact agency stage, regulatory signal causing friction, timeline evidence. Must read like an internal briefing.
- **Personalization intelligence** ("Why Them"): Ties it all together — company/backer → project friction → permitting risk exposure → what's actionable. Not "this project is delayed" but "here's the permitting risk this fund is carrying on this project and why they need to quantify it now." Connect the specific permit delay to the financial exposure the backer faces — IRR erosion, capital sitting idle, LP reporting gaps, pro forma revisions. Every "Why Them" should read like a reason the fund needs to take a meeting about permitting risk, not a summary of what's happening.
- **Key Contact column**: `"Name | Role (Title) | Firm | Project"`. Found via web search only — no Playwright, no LinkedIn, no Hunter. Multiple contacts separated by semicolon. Example: `"Jane Doe | Asset Manager (VP Asset Management) | Stonepeak | Brazoria Solar Farm"`. `"contact not found"` if neither role found.
- **Verification rule**: Every person-to-project connection must be verified by a real source. Finding a person at a fund does NOT mean they are connected to a specific project. Agent must run verification searches (`"[Person] [Project/Company]"`, `"[Person] [Fund] [state] infrastructure"`) and only include verified connections. Unverified = `"contact not found"`. A wrong connection is worse than no connection.
- Agent runs follow-up searches per company to extract project-level specifics (not just surface signals)
- Tab and headers are created automatically by the MCP tool
- Agent reads the sheet first via `read_proof_sheet` to check existing companies and skip duplicates
- Results written incrementally as the agent finds them (not batched at the end)
- `count` = exact number of companies to return. If count is 1, agent runs one search and picks one company
- Google Sheet shared with `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@thepfi.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Uses `googleapis` npm package with the Firebase service account credentials

### Source Credibility Rules
- Every company picked by the agent (in both `findLeads` and `proofSheet`) **must come from a real, verifiable source** with an actual URL
- Acceptable: government filings, regulatory databases (permits.performance.gov, FERC, TCEQ, etc.), major industry publications, official project announcements
- Not acceptable: unverified sources, speculative content, AI-generated summaries, questionable/unknown websites
- No source URL = no save. Agent skips any result it cannot verify.

### Dual-Channel Tracking
- Leads can have email, LinkedIn, or both contact methods
- Each channel tracked independently: `emailSent` and `linkedinSent` fields
- **Partial completion**: Yellow badge ("Email Sent" or "LinkedIn Sent") when one channel is done
- **Full completion**: Green "Done" badge when all available channels are complete
- Dashboard shows a LinkedIn icon button next to partial-status leads for manual LinkedIn completion

### Playwright / LinkedIn Session
- Used **only during lead discovery** (finding LinkedIn profile URLs via search)
- Uses persistent browser context saved at `~/.pfi-linkedin-session/`
- First time only: user logs into LinkedIn manually in the Playwright browser window
- Session persists across agent restarts
- Agent must always use `chromium.launchPersistentContext()`, never `chromium.launch()` or CDP
- **Not used for sending connection requests** — that's manual

### MCP Server (`Tools/mcp-server/index.js`)
13 tools exposed:
- `search_web(query)` — Tavily API web search, returns structured results
- `enrich_contact(firstName, lastName, domain)` — Hunter email finder, returns email or null
- `send_email(userId, leadId, to, subject, body)` — Gmail SMTP send, sets `emailSent: true`, only sets `done: true` if LinkedIn is also complete (or not applicable). Enforces daily email limit
- `get_skill(userId)` — Read user's skill document
- `get_pending_leads(userId, needsMessage?)` — Get leads where done=false
- `save_leads(userId, leads[])` — Save new leads with dedup by LinkedIn URL and email. Includes `institutionalBacker` field for the PE fund/investor behind the company
- `save_message(userId, leadId, message, subject?, linkedinNote?)` — Save outreach message to a lead. Email leads: `message` (body) + `subject` + optional `linkedinNote`. LinkedIn-only leads: `message` (connection note under 300 chars)
- `mark_lead_done(userId, leadId)` — Sets `linkedinSent: true`, only sets `done: true` if email is also complete (or not applicable). Increments daily LinkedIn counter, enforces limit
- `get_daily_count(userId)` — Today's LinkedIn + email counts, limits, and remaining
- `poll_tasks(userId)` — Check for pending tasks
- `complete_task(userId, taskName)` — Mark task as complete
- `read_proof_sheet(spreadsheetId)` — Read all existing rows from the "Proof Sheet" tab. Returns array of row objects (7 fields). Used before writing to check what companies are already in the sheet and avoid duplicates.
- `write_proof_sheet(spreadsheetId, rows[])` — Append rows to a single "Proof Sheet" tab. Each row has 7 fields: company, institutional_backer, classification (Active Pain/Capital Pattern), whats_happening (situational intelligence: project name, capacity, location, agency stage, regulatory signal, timeline), why_them (personalization intelligence: person-specific, tied to key contact's role and this project's friction), key_contact (format: "Name | Role (Title) | Firm | Project"; web search only, no LinkedIn/Hunter), source. Auto-creates tab and headers. Uses `USER_ENTERED` mode.

### Environment Variables (MCP Server)
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` — Tavily web search
- `HUNTER_API_KEY` — Hunter.io email finder
- `GMAIL_USER` — Gmail address for outreach
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` — Gmail app password

### Firestore Data Model
- `company/employees` — `{ list: [{ name, role, email }] }`
- `company/config` — `{ skillTemplate: "..." }` with `{{name}}` and `{{role}}` placeholders
- `users/{uid}/profile/main` — `{ onboarded, skill, name, role, linkedinLimit, emailLimit, linkedin_YYYY-MM-DD, email_YYYY-MM-DD, claudeStarted }`
- `users/{uid}/leads/{leadId}` — `{ name, company, role, linkedin, email, institutionalBacker, channel, enrichmentSource, message, emailSubject, linkedinNote, emailSent, emailSentAt, linkedinSent, linkedinSentAt, done, createdAt, sentAt }`
- `users/{uid}/tasks/{taskName}` — `{ status: "pending"|"complete", createdAt }`. Task names: `findLeads` (+ count), `writeMessages`, `performOutreach`, `proofSheet` (+ count, spreadsheetId)

### Testing Mode
**Currently active.** Both `Tools/mcp-server/index.js` and `Team/index.html` have a `ROOT_COLLECTION` constant set to `'test'` instead of `'users'`. This routes all reads/writes to the `test` Firestore collection. Test data seeded via `Tools/seed/seed-test.js`. **Switch back to `'users'` in both files when done testing.**

### Dashboard UI
- Lead table columns: Name | Role | Company | Backer | Channel | Contact | Message | Status
- Lead table with real-time Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners
- Message modal (popup) for viewing/editing email and LinkedIn messages separately
- Status column: Pending (gray) → partial (yellow, "Email Sent" or "LinkedIn Sent") → Done (green)
- LinkedIn icon button appears next to partial-status leads for manual completion
- Daily counters (LinkedIn + email) update in real time via `onSnapshot`

### Firestore Rules
- `company/*` — read: open, write: console only
- `users/*` — read/write: open (internal tool)
- `test/*` — read/write: open (testing only, remove when done)

### Skill System
Master skill template in `company/config` gets personalized per user (replace `{{name}}` and `{{role}}`). Claude Code sets up the Claude Project with instructions automatically on first run.

### Daily Limits
Default: 20/day for both LinkedIn and email (separate counters). Stored as `linkedin_YYYY-MM-DD` and `email_YYYY-MM-DD` fields. Top bar shows both counters. Color: gray (safe) → orange (80%) → red (at limit). `mark_lead_done` enforces LinkedIn limit server-side, `send_email` enforces email limit server-side.

## Workflow
- Marketing site: sections rebuilt one at a time to match design screenshots
- Outreach system: follow P.md confirmation protocol (plan → "Approved" → code)
- Keep styles consistent with PFI design language (Inter font, #1C2B3A, #2E6DA4)
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

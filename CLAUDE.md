# PFI — Permitting Friction Index Website

## Overview
Static single-page marketing site for the Permitting Friction Index (PFI) — the first empirical measurement of permitting timeline variance for large-scale US infrastructure projects.

## Tech Stack
- Single `index.html` file with inline CSS and JS (no build tools, no frameworks)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- No dependencies

## Page Structure
1. **Hero** — Full-viewport background image with logo and mist widget
2. **Flipper 1: Intro ↔ What PFI Measures** — Arrow-based page flipper with fade+slide animation
3. **Flipper 2: Initial Coverage ↔ Who Uses The PFI** — Split layout (image left/top, text flips right/below)
4. **Founding Subscribers** — Notion-style centered text with email link
5. **Footer**

## Flipper Mechanism
- Arrow buttons slide content horizontally like turning a page
- Coordinated animation: fade-out → 300ms delay → slide track + fade-in (1s cubic-bezier easing)
- Progressive reveal: sections hidden until user clicks through each flipper
- Flipper viewport height locks to active page content to prevent white space
- Flipper 2 text container height locks to active page; uses `align-items: flex-start` on track so pages size independently

## Design System
The site uses a Notion-inspired design language with reusable CSS classes:
- `.notion-section`, `.notion-content` — Section containers (max-width: 720px, centered)
- `.notion-label` — Small gray category label
- `.notion-title` — Section heading (28px, semibold)
- `.notion-subheading` — Subsection heading (18px, bold)
- `.notion-body` — Body text (16px, #555)
- `.notion-split` — Two-column grid layout for image+text sections
- `.flipper-arrow` — Circular arrow button for flipping between content pages

## Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop** — Side-by-side grid for section 3, full nav text
- **Tablet (≤1024px)** — Reduced padding
- **Mobile (≤768px)** — LOCKED IN. Nav shows "PFI" instead of full name, section 3 stacks image above text (edge-to-edge), flipper2 labels hidden, footer centered
- **Small phone (≤400px)** — LOCKED IN. Further size reductions

## Assets
- Images live in `assets/`
- Design reference screenshots (PNG) are also in `assets/`

## Workflow
- Sections are rebuilt one at a time to match design screenshots provided by the user
- Keep styles consistent with the established Notion-style design system
- Prefer editing the single index.html file over creating new files
